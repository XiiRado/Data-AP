# Data-AP

This is my Data Analytics Portfolio, I have been using Cisco for some free extra training alongside my Cyber Security Degree.

My main interests when it comes to data are:
- Crime
- Sports
- Government Policies

My intention is to use this portfolio during my Cisco training and then carry on adding to this so that it can be used as my professional portfolio.
